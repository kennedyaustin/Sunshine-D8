# Webpage Components
Libraries​: <br>

# APIs:

● Yelp -- https://www.yelp.com/dataset○https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main & https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
Yelp Fusion
We used this API to pull details from Yelp’s database for two searches: Restaurants & Activities. 
We created selector fields for type and zip code for each to return appropriate results.
(AJAX Used to pull data) 

● Mapbox -- https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/
Map Box
We used this API to show where the results pulled from Yelp are located. The user can quickly see where the various results are based on the interactive map. 
(AJAX Used to pull data)
